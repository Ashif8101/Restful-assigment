Each API endpoint becomes a resource with methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n","\n","Built-in Request Parsing: Flask-RESTful comes with an easy-to-use request parser that allows you to define expected parameters, validate input, and extract data from the request. It supports JSON, form data, and query parameters.\n","\n","Automatic Response Formatting: It provides a convenient way to send structured JSON responses. The extension automatically serializes the data to JSON and ensures a consistent response format.\n","\n","Support for HTTP Methods: It enables the use of common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in a clean and simple way by using method-specific functions in the resource class.\n","\n","Better Structure for Large APIs: Flask-RESTful promotes the separation of concerns, allowing for a more organized API structure. Each resource can be encapsulated in its own class, making the code more modular and maintainable.\n","\n","Error Handling: Flask-RESTful provides easy error handling and can automatically return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) along with error messages.\n","\n","Integration with Flask-SQLAlchemy: Flask-RESTful can easily be integrated with Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with databases in a structured manner, making it easier to manage data models and queries.\n","\n","#***example***\n","\n","```python\n","from flask import Flask, jsonify\n","from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse\n","\n","app = Flask(__name__)\n","api = Api(app)\n","\n","# Define a Resource class for a specific endpoint\n","class HelloWorld(Resource):\n","    def get(self):\n","        return jsonify(message=\"Hello, World!\")\n","\n","class User(Resource):\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.req_parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n","        self.req_parser.add_argument('name', type=str, required=True, help=\"Name cannot be blank\")\n","        self.req_parser.add_argument('email', type=str, required=True, help=\"Email cannot be blank\")\n","\n","    def post(self):\n","        args = self.req_parser.parse_args()\n","        return jsonify(message=f\"User {args['name']} with email {args['email']} created\"), 201\n","\n","# Add resources to the API\n","api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')\n","api.add_resource(User, '/user')\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    app.run(debug=True)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NhdPFWq6c3Hz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["23.

When a user sends a request, the server sends the session data back to the client as a cookie, which is then sent with every subsequent request.\n","\n","Server-Side Storage: Although the session data is stored on the client-side (as cookies), it is securely signed and encrypted by Flask, so it is safe for storing small, non-sensitive information like user preferences, language settings, or authentication tokens.\n","\n","```python\n","from flask import Flask, session, redirect, url_for, request, render_template_string\n","\n","app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","# Set a secret key to sign session cookies\n","app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'\n","\n","@app.route('/')\n","def index():\n","    # Check if the user is logged in by checking the session\n","    if 'username' in session:\n","        return f'Logged in as {session[\"username\"]}'\n","    return 'You are not logged in'\n","\n","@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n","def login():\n","    if request.method == 'POST':\n","        session['username'] = request.form['username']  # Store user in session\n","        return redirect(url_for('index'))\n","    return '''\n","        <form method=\"post\">\n","            Username: <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\">\n","            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\">\n","        </form>\n","    '''\n","\n","@app.route('/logout')\n","def logout():\n","    session.pop('username', None)  # Remove the user from session\n","    return redirect(url_for('index'))\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    app.run(debug=True)\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"GYhd0kd9dsqM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"MEs_X1kFY4cx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
